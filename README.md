\# Changeable Neural Network

 

A neural network whose no. of layers and the units for each layers can be manipulated by just changing the input entries.

\### Prerequisites

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)
* [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [Pandads](https://pandas.pydata.org/getpandas.html)



\### Getting started

 

* Copy the code in your python editor 
* Similarly replace "Corners.txt" with your own file of dataset.
* Change the hyperparameters learning_rate , iterations if you wish.
* Change the layers and units in each layers as per your problem.
* Run the code and wait for results.
